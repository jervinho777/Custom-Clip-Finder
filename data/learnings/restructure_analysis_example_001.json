    "Keep segments that enumerate multiple emotions/needs in quick succession (e.g., 'Einsamkeit, Scham, Liebe') because lists create perceived authority and speed.",
    "Choose segments containing a vivid, concrete scene the viewer can picture instantly (kids knocking on glass; ape turning away).",
    "Keep segments that include a clear injustice/constraint metric (e.g., '150 Quadratmeter', 'Gruppe ... nicht selbst gesucht') to make the argument falsifiable and sticky.",
    "End on a strong normative verdict ('v\u00f6llig absurd', 'nicht mehr zeitgem\u00e4\u00df') to provide closure and shareability.",
    "Remove segments that require domain backstory (fish supply chain, whale shark pricing) unless the clip\u2019s core claim depends on it.",
    "Remove interviewer questions, topic pivots, and hedging phrases; keep uninterrupted monologue blocks for retention.",
    "Avoid segments dominated by numbers/credentials unless they directly intensify the ethical punch (here, only '150 Quadratmeter' is kept because it dramatizes confinement)."
